## Project 1: Lane Lines Image Detection w/ OpenCV

The goal of this project was to use Python and OpenCV to create an image processing pipeline to detect the lane lines in a video taken from a car travelling along a road. The pipeline I created has the following steps:


1. Convert RGB image to grayscale
2. Apply Gaussian filter to image
3. Use Canny Edge detection to find strong lines within image
4. Apply a Region of Interest Mask in order to just look at the lane lines
5. Hough Transform the image to create two continuous lines, one for each lane line
6. Draw the detected lane lines over top of the original image

The following GIF shows the output of the lane line detection pipeline:

## Project 2: Semantic Segmentation via Deep Neural Net (DNN)

The goal of this project was to create a DNN with PyTorch which would be able produce a semantic segmentation model which achieves a mean Intersection over Union (mIOU) score of >40%.

Semantic Segmentation is the task of catergorizing each pixel in some input image into a specifc class.
